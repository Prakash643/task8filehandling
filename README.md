TASK 8 – File Handling Using Python (TXT & CSV)
About This Task

This task is part of my internship learning program.
The goal of this task is to understand how Python works with files and how data can be stored permanently using TXT and CSV files.

In real projects, data is not always stored in variables.
It is stored in files. This task helped me learn that concept practically.

What I Have Implemented
1. TXT File Handling

I created a Python program to work with a text file.

Using this program, I:

Created a TXT file using Python

Wrote user/intern details into the file

Read the file content

Appended new data to the existing file

Handled file-related errors using exception handling

This helped me understand basic file operations such as write, read, and append.

2. CSV File Handling

I created another Python program to work with a CSV file using the csv module.

Using this program, I:

Created a CSV file

Added column headers

Inserted multiple rows of data

Read and displayed CSV data row by row

This helped me understand how structured data is stored and handled in real-world applications.
